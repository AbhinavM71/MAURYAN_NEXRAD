An Arithmetic Logic-Unit (ALU) is an integral circuital component of a
computer processor (CPU). It is used to perform various arithmetic such
as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and bitwise logic
operations such as OR and AND etc. The memory stores the programâ€™s
instructions and data.
This project aims to design and simulate a floating-point
single-precision (32 bit) ALU which performs arithmetic operations and
logic operations. All of these operations are realized using Verilog HDL,
compiled, and simulated using Modelsim. The Floating-point numbers
are represented in strict accordance with the IEEE standard 754.
